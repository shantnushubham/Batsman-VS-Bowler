# Batsman-VS-Bowler
This is a very special project in which, my model compares a batsman and a bowler and tells which one is a better player by an analysis on their ball by ball data that they have played in all the T20s
The model does the analysis on the merged dataset, where we first identify the best batsmen and bowlers in all the matches and the specifically in the last 4 overs.
We compare the batsmen using the strike rates and the bowlers using the economy rates and then create a compare function to compare the better cricketor.
